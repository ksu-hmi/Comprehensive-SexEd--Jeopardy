# Comprehensive-sex-ed-app
We are creating a comprehensive sex education app for children between the ages of 5 to 18, and adults who have general questions and concerns. 

# Installation

# Description
This app will have a plethora of topics and questions that will help to delineate what sex is. When you first open the app, there will be six different tabs. The first three tabs will cater to elementary-age students, middle-aged students, and high school students. Also, there will be a tab for parents, questions and concerns, and a tap for the LGBTQ community.

The purpose of this project is to decrease the number of STI's and STD's among not only young people but older adults as well.
