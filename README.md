# Comprehensive-sex-ed-app
We are creating a comprehensive sex education jeopardy game for children between the ages of 5 to 18, and adults who have general questions and concerns. 

# Installation
[placeholder] We are going to figure this out as we create the code

# Description
This jeopardy game will have a plethora of topics and questions that will help to delineate what sex is. When you first open the app, there will be six different tabs. The first three tabs will cater to elementary-age students, middle-aged students, and high school students. 

The purpose of this project is to decrease the number of STI's and STD's among not only young people but older adults as well.
